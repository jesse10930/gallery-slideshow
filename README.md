## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- TypeScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

My goal for this project was the get practice with TypeScript and Styled Components. Although TypeScript is still a bit confusing for me, this project has helped me come a long way to understanding better. Styled Components are a nice way to keep components all in one file. However, I do wonder if having the styles in the same file as the markup becomes confusing for larger projects with multiple developers.

### Continued development

I definitely need to continue working with both of these technologies to continue gaining an understanding of their use and value. I would also like to continue building my testing skills to make my apps more complete.
